# Pugtime

This is what happens when I am bored.
Repo includes a discord bot (you'll have to host it yourself) and a client only version in Python.
I love Python, okay?
Maybe will make a PowerShell version of the client, or just use your calendar, lazy bums.

Special thanks to:
Fffreak - Forcing me to actually fix the bot. :|
Testman - Helping me with timezones. ;)
Damiankill - Pointing out the fact that I once again missed some TAB's. :/
